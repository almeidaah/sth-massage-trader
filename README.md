Simple app for massage trading :D ##Developed just 4fun##

* Developed just for fun. Non commercial purposes.

TODO list:

* Add profiles to properties(spring.active.profiles) to choose when use dev or production application.properties
* Use logo image inside project(today is a URL). Also, should fix the image position on login form.
* Should remove automatically login object when /logout (Today is setting to null, avoid this way).
* General Improvements on CSS/JS (to better UX)
* Avoid HARDCODED messages in code(Externalize to .properties file). I.e: MailUtil.sendMail has a lot of hardcoded text.
